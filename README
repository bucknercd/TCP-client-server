This is a simple TCP client-server setup which runs on port 9000. The tcp server will receive a message 
from the tcp client. It will then append a small message to the front of the message
it just received and will send the newly created message back to the client. The client
will print the received message to stdout. The TCP server will fork a process to handle
every request.

To make server and client:
$ make

To run server:
$ make server

To run client:
$ make client

** A pcap file is included which shows the tcp interaction between client/server.
Just open it up with wireshark.
